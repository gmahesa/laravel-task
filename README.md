# laravel-task
contain my laravel projects during college
<br><br>
not all projects are funtional, some projects was fail or not 100% completed. i just want to save these projects to remind me if I ever try to learn it.
<br><br>
(some files not uploaded, too much files)

laravel-1 (website for recording lost and found items), the crud still does not work so its not saving anything. its originally from my other laravel projects just changing some files but fail to adjust to make it work. <br><br>

laravel-2 (news website) it works just fine with the CRUD and user
